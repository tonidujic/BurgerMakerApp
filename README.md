# 🍔 BurgerMakerApp

This mini application was created as part of my JavaScript practice. The purpose of this app is to simulate the process of burger creation using asynchronous functions (`async/await`) and to demonstrate the use of **JSDoc comments** for documenting JavaScript code.

## 🚀 Features
- Simulates burger creation steps such as grilling, preparing buns, vegetables, and assembling the burger.
- Utilizes `async/await` and `Promise` to handle asynchronous operations in sequence.
- Clean separation of concerns with a logger to show the current status of each step.
- Includes form submission for selecting a burger type.
- Demonstrates proper use of **JSDoc** comments to document functions and parameters.

## 📂 Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure with form and logger.
- `index.css` - Basic styling.
- `index.js` - Contains the JavaScript logic with async functions, event handling, and JSDoc comments.

## 📚 Key Concepts Practiced
- **AJAX and Asynchronous JavaScript**: Handling asynchronous steps using `async/await` and Promises.
- **JSDoc Documentation**: Using standardized comments to describe function behavior, parameters, and return values.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Updating the UI dynamically to reflect progress.
